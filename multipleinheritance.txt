Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, wherea class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. 
The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass.On calling the method, the compiler cannot 
determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority.
So in order to resolve method ambiguity and constructor chaining ambiguity we use interface for acheiveing multiple inheritance.
