length():
 length() method is a final variable which is applicable for string objects. The length() method returns the number of characters 
 present in the string. 


Hybrid inheritance:
 In simple terms you can say that Hybrid inheritance is a combination of Single and Multiple inheritance. A typical flow diagram would look like 
 below. A hybrid inheritance can be achieved in the java in a same way as multiple inheritance can be!! Using interfaces. yes you heard it right.
 By using interfaces you can have multiple as well as hybrid inheritance in Java

Multiple inheritance:
Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics
 and features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only 
 inherit from one particular object or class.
 Multiple inheritance has been a controversial issue for many years,[1][2] with opponents pointing to its increased complexity and ambiguity in
 situations such as the "diamond problem", where it may be ambiguous as to which parent class a particular feature is inherited from if more than 
 one parent class implements same feature. This can be addressed in various ways, including using virtual inheritance.[3] Alternate methods of
 object composition not based on inheritance such as mixins and traits have also been proposed to address the ambiguity.
