For Each:-It starts with the keyword for like a normal for-loop.
Instead of declaring and initializing a loop variable,here we declare a variable that is the same type as the base type 
of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
In the loop body, we can use the loop variable you created rather than using an indexed array element. 
 Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class 
Syntax: 
for (type var : array) 
{ 
    statements using var;
}
